# optimization
 Developed and implemented optimization algorithms including Bounding Phase and Interval Halving for Unidirec-
tional Search, Conjugate Gradient Method for Unconstrained Optimization, and Bracket-Operator Penalty Method
for Constrained Optimization. Conducted performance analysis by highlighting best and worst solutions, and ad-
dressed challenges such as convergence on local minima and high function evaluations.
